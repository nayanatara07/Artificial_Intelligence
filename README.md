# Artificial Intelligence Repository

Welcome to the Artificial Intelligence Repository! This repository contains mini-codes for various AI-based real-time problems. Below, you'll find a brief overview of each problem included in this repository:

## Problems Included

### 1. Vaccum Cleaner
This code simulates a simple autonomous vacuum cleaner agent that operates in a 2D grid environment. The vacuum cleaner is programmed to move around the grid, cleaning dirty cells it encounters, until the entire grid is clean.

### 2. Wumpus World
In this problem, you'll find code for an intelligent agent navigating through a cave-like environment inhabited by a Wumpus, pits, and treasure. The agent must use knowledge about the environment to explore safely, avoid dangers, and collect the treasure.

### 3. 8-Puzzle Problem
The 8-puzzle problem involves a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one empty space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles from a given initial configuration to a goal configuration by sliding tiles into the empty space. This code provides a solution to this classic puzzle using AI search algorithms.

### 4. Sudoku Game
Sudoku is a popular puzzle game where players fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, row, and 3x3 subgrid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. This code allows you to play Sudoku interactively and provides solving algorithms to find solutions to Sudoku puzzles.
